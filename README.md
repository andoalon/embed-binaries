# embed-binaries

Easy-to-use CMake utility to generate C/C++ code containing binary data from files.
Useful when you want to avoid shipping extra files, but you want to still have them separately during development.

## Features

* Generates arrays containing binary data as C/C++ source files
* Single CMake file with no dependencies except CMake >=3.17.5. Copy the file to your project and start using it!
* Generated source files are updated at build-time whenever the original asset gets modified (CMake's `add_custom_command` is used)
* Platform-independent, as all of the implementation is written in CMake
* Can optionally generate a `constexpr` array for compile-time manipulation in C++

## Reference

```cmake
embed_binaries(<generated_target_name>
  [ASSET
    NAME <name> PATH <path> [BYTE_TYPE <c-cpp-type>] [CONSTEXPR] [NULL_TERMINATE]
  ]...)
```

* `NAME`: name of the asset (the name of the generated file and variable)
* `PATH`: path to the asset file (absolute of relative to `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`)
* `BYTE_TYPE`: type of the elements of the generated array. Defaults to: `"unsigned char"`. Useful when embedding ascii string data (use `BYTE_TYPE "char"`)
* `CONSTEXPR`: by default, an extern const array will be declared in the header, with the contents in a corresponding .c file, which makes the header as short as possible, which improves compile time, especially when embedding larger assets
* `NULL_TERMINATE`: append a null-terminator (`0` byte) at the end of the embedded data. Useful when embedding string data that will be used with APIs expecting null-terminated strings

## Example

See the `example/` directory for a full example project

```cmake
include("path/to/embed-binaries.cmake")

embed_binaries(my-embedded-binaries
    ASSET
        NAME "application_logo"
        PATH "assets/application_logo.png"
    ASSET
        NAME "vertex_shader"
        PATH "shaders/dummy_shader.vert"
        BYTE_TYPE "char"
    
        CONSTEXPR
        
        # OpenGL does not require null-terminated string for shaders, this is not a good example
        NULL_TERMINATE
    # ASSET ...
)

add_executable(my-executable
    # files...
)
target_link_libraries(my-executable PRIVATE my-embedded-binaries)
```
